# Docker-Falsk-Redis
### Description:
On this page you build a simple Python web application running on Docker Compose. The application uses the Flask framework and maintains a hit counter in Redis. While the sample uses Python, the concepts demonstrated here should be understandable even if youâ€™re not familiar with it.
  
### STEPS:
#### 1) Download this repository in a specific folder then open terminal and move to that folder where you save your downloaded files.

~~~
docker-compose up 
~~~

#### 2) Then go to any browser and type localhost:5000 to access the flask application with redis database.
